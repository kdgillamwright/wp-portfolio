    <h1>WEB DEVELOPER</h1>
    <h4>CRAFTING USER-FRIENDLY WEB EXPERIENCES</h4>
    <p class="intro-blurb">
      As a current IT Web Programming student, I've cultivated
      skills in creating responsive and dynamic web solutions.
      My coursework and collaborative projects with fellow
      classmates have provided me with hands-on experience in
      transforming concepts into reality.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-blurb">
      When I'm not immersed in lines of code or exploring new programming concepts, you'll often find me indulging in my
      passion for crafting. Whether it's making signs, painting or 3D printing, I find joy in bringing ideas to life.
      Equally important to me is spending cherished moments with my family, as they provide the grounding and
      inspiration that fuel my journey in both technology and life.
